         <p>Eagle is the common name for the golden eagle,     bald eagle, and other birds of prey in the family     of the Accipitridae.<br>Eagles belong to several     groups of genera, some of which are closely     related. True eagles comprise the genus Aquila.     Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia     and Africa<br>Outside this area, just 14 species     can be foundâ€”two in North America, nine in Central     and South America, and three in Australia.<br>
         Eagles are not a natural group but denote     essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough     to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall)     vertebrates.</p>
