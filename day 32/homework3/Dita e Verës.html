        <p>Dita e Verës is celebrated on March 1 of the Julian calendar, the first day of the new year (which is March 14 in the Gregorian calendar). It is celebrated both in the Northern and Southern regions, but with regional differences. On the eve or before sunrise, bonfires (zjarre) are traditionally lit in yards throughout Abanian-inhabited territories with the function to drive away the darkness of the winter season and for the strengthening of the Sun, as well as for purification and apotropaic purposes. The ritual is performed with people dancing and singing around the fire or jumping across it.</p>
