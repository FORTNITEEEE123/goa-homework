        <h1>this page is about legos</h1>
        <p>LEGOs are plastic building-block toys that rose to massive popularity in the mid-20th century. The word LEGO is from the Danish phrase leg godt (“play well”). The basic LEGO brick has remained the same since the 1950s, and this simple, child-friendly design has been credited with the toys longevity.</p>
